Modern Hardware -
Rough plan - A website which connects shopkeeprs to direct end consumers, plumbers, electricians and others through online website.


Explained plan -
Concept - A online shopping is common these days. In urban as well as rurual areas e commerce is common these days. With current domination of flipkart and amazon for end consumer all kinds of goods, swiggy and zomato in food, there are others in medical products also. Now its time for hardware and other products which are not touched yet in my opinion.


How and what connects-
1) First of all listing of products and making a master catalog ready as product is important thing.
2) Matching those products with sellers available
3) Product and seller availabilty to be done based on actual customer location or area pincode. Then only share those products to the customer unless customer selects the broader area.
4) Shipping cost and time is lower as the hyperlocal deliveries possible.
5) Separate page should be there for plumbers and other contractors as the end customer may not know how to use and install particular parts.
6) Contact number of sellers should be provided for customer to get best rate and discount by calling the retailer as well as its helpful for clearing doubts.

1)Directly able to connect with sellers and get the products online to get doorstep delivery
2)Best possible rates and further discounts

4)Product availabilty from nearby retailers reducing delivery cost to very less or nil if possible (as under hyperlocal).


Benefits to retailers -

2)More sells and online visibilty
3)Order management possible via online as well as offline via call.
4)Pricing transperancy among competing sellers.
